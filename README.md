### Project Overview

This project centers on analyzing COVID-19 data to develop a dynamic Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard using SQL and Tableau. The goal is to enhance public health insights by examining global COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination trends, providing a comprehensive view of the pandemic’s impact across different regions.

### Objectives

- Global Analysis of COVID Cases and Deaths: Organize and analyze data on COVID-19 cases and mortality rates globally to observe geographic and temporal trends.
- Vaccination Insights: Assess vaccination distribution and uptake by country and continent, correlating it with infection and mortality rates.
- Interactive Visualization for Public Health Intelligence: Develop an accessible dashboard that highlights critical COVID-19 trends to support informed decision-making in public health.

### Solution Highlights

- SQL Data Processing and ETL: SQL was utilized to clean and structure raw COVID-19 data into two main tables—cases/deaths and vaccinations—allowing for efficient analysis. Metrics such as total cases, death rates, and vaccination percentages were calculated, along with rolling counts and data views for seamless integration with Tableau.
- Comprehensive Tableau Dashboard: Through Tableau, I designed visualizations including a global case overview, continent-based death metrics, infection rate maps, and time-series analyses of COVID growth in selected countries. By strategically using color, layout, and interactivity, the dashboard serves as an intuitive tool for understanding complex pandemic patterns.
- Integrated BI Approach: By consolidating SQL and Tableau, the project provides a streamlined BI solution that translates raw data into meaningful, actionable insights, enabling a deep dive into COVID trends and regional impacts.

### Impact

This project exemplifies the application of SQL and Tableau for BI and data analytics, demonstrating how a cohesive ETL and visualization strategy can yield valuable insights. The dashboard not only facilitates a user-friendly exploration of COVID-19 data but also promotes informed public health decisions and underscores the potential of data-driven intelligence in managing global challenges.
